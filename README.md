# Speaker-Verification
Speaker Verification using Siamese Network

1) Created the dataset for Speaker verification by forming pairs of speech signals & assigned the labels by posing it as a binary classification problem wherein positive class represents that the pair belongs to the same speaker & negative class represents that the pair belongs to different speakers.
2) Trained a Siamese network which provides a fixed dimension embedding to the speech signals.
3) Used the generated embeddings to compute the similarity between two speech signals thus assigning the class label based on the similarity score obtained for the pair.
4) Technologies Used : Python,Tensorflow
